snowplow-web 1.0.0 (2023-12-05)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version marks a major milestone as we move the package into a 1.0.0 release. The release itself only makes a few fixes for some issues, but this state marks the package as stable and production ready. This package will only receive critical bug fixes going forward as we invest our effort in new packages and projects. 

## Breaking changes
- We now require a dbt version >=1.6.0 to run this package

# Fixes
- Set default variables for contexts (Close #54)
- Replace old macro in custom example (Close #236)
- Remove full version number for core web vitals from bigquery (Close #235)

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.16.2 (2023-10-20)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version fixes an incorrect default value for the `snowplow__cwv_context` variable for Redshift/Postgres users. There is no action needed from any users on this change.

## Fixes
- Fix incorrect default table name for core web vitals on redshift

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.16.1 (2023-10-06)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version fixes an issue where the app_id filter was being ignored in the new models.

## Fixes
- Correctly process app id filter

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.16.0 (2023-09-19)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version adds a load of new features, powered by a complete refactor of the core processing of the package by moving it out to the new `base` macro functionality provided in `snowplow_utils`. This enables users to now specify custom fields for sessionization and user identification, to add custom entities/SDEs fields to the base events table for redshift/postgres, and to add passthrough fields to the derived tables so you can now more easily add your own fields to our tables. In addition we've increased the flexibility of how you apply user stitching, and made it available on the page views table! 

From this release onwards, the package is being released under the [Snowplow Community License, Version 1.0](https://docs.snowplow.io/community-license-1.0/). If you are uncertain how it applies to your use case, check our answers to [frequently asked questions](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/contributing/community-license-faq/).

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Bumped required dbt version to 1.5.0
- Added new fields (`original_domain_sessionid` and `original_domain_userid`) to all tables to support custom identifiers
- Bumped snowplow_utils required version to 0.15.0
- Altered entity/self-describing table variables to only be table names, instead of source strings
- Renamed columns in quarantined sessions and sessions lifecycle manifest table (please run the ALTER TABLE statements in the migration guide or do a full-refresh)
- Seeds have been renamed to be prefixed with `snowplow_web_*` to align with the rest of the package, and now you can use your own seed files or tables in their place (see the package config)

## Features
- Migrate base models to the new `base` macros for flexibility and consistency
- Add ability to add custom entity/self-describing event columns to the `base_events_this_run` table for Redshift/Postgres

- Add ability to run user stitching on the derived page views table

## Under the hood
- Aligned variables to follow the public docs
- Contexts are now joined and de-duped via a macro for Postgres/Redshift
- But filtering is now case insensitive

snowplow-web 0.16.0-rc1 (2023-08-31)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release candidate adds a load of new features, powered by a complete refactor of the core processing of the package by moving it out to the new `base` macro functionality provided in `snowplow_utils`. This enables users to now specify custom fields for sessionization and user identification, to add custom entities/SDEs fields to the base events table for redshift/postgres, and to add passthrough fields to the derived tables so you can now more easily add your own fields to our tables.

snowplow-web 0.15.2 (2023-07-28)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version fixes a rare bug in the event of null values on specific fields used by the Core Web Vitals optional module.

## Fixes
- Prevent duplicates in web vital measurements (Close #215)

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.15.1 (2023-07-25)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version brings Redshift/Postgres support for the optional Core Web Vitals module, adds the `default channel group` field to the derived page_views table, contains a fix for Redshift users based on a default column size, another for Core Web Vital users and also adds the package name to the run limits log. Note the `snowplow_utils` minimum version has now increased to 0.14.3.

## Features
- Add Redshift/Postgres support for Core Web Vitals
- Add default channel group to page views (Close #211)
- Added package name to run limits log message
- Handle unexpected high web vital values (Close #208)

## Fixes
- Fix issue with new runs of Redshift due to default column size.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
Existing Core Web Vital optional module users on Snowflake and Databricks will need to make changes to one of their derived tables. For a full sql script on how to achieve this, check out the relevant [migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/web/) The other option is to do a [complete refresh](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-operation/#complete-refresh-of-snowplow-package) of the package.

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.15.0 (2023-06-21)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
The main change in this version is the addition of many new fields to the derived tables (`sessions`, `pageviews`, `users`), including the ability to define your conversion events that are aggregated per session. You can read more about it in our docs [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-web-data-model/conversions/)! We also add the (optional) count of events per event type for each session, you can enable it by turning on the `snowplow__list_event_counts` variable.

There is a new optional module called `core web vitals` which will allow you to model raw events sent from the **Snowplow Web Vitals plugin** (@snowplow/browser-plugin-web-vitals) of the [JavaScript tracker](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/index.md) to measure and evaluate the speed, responsiveness, and visual stability of websites.

This version also moves the iab, ua, and yauaa contexts into the base events this run table for Postgres/Redshift, completing the work to decouple our sessions models from the page view models for all warehouses.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨

Please note that we have added a variable, `snowplow__enable_consent` to enable the models in the consent module. Please make sure you set this variable to true in your dbt_project.yml file to be able to run them:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

vars:
  snowplow_web:
    snowplow__enable_consent: true
```

While not breaking in that your models should all still run, there are many new columns in the sessions, pageviews and users tables that will be automatically added to your derived tables, which may have unintended consequences with existing queries or BI tools that use column position (although dbt usually appends these columns to the end). New columns will only be populated from new runs onwards, if you wish to populate them for older records you will need to do a full refresh.

## Features
- Move contexts into base table for redshift (Close #185)
- Add support for user-defined conversion aggregation to sessions
- Add new fields to the sessions table including enhanced and last geo data, default channel group, marketing source platform, event count, and optional count by event_name
- Add new fields to the users table relating to the latest event geo and browser information
- Add core web vitals module

## Under the hood
- Optimizes a filter in the `snowplow_web_user_sessions_this_run` model (Close #186)
- Ensure deterministic modeling when two genuine events occur at the same time in a session (Close #178)

## Docs
- Remove docs that are no longer necessary

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

Some of the tables are relying now on seeds that have just been introduced with this version (`dim_ga4_source_categories`, `dim_geo_country_mapping`,`dim_rfc_5646_language_mapping`). Please run `dbt seed --select snowplow_web --full-refresh` on your first run.

snowplow-web 0.14.1 (2023-05-23)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version fixes an issue for new runs of the package on redshift where empty text field sizes were set to a length of 1.

## Fixes
- Fixes error with new install on redshift for character varying field sizes.

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.14.0 (2023-03-28)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version contains two major changes, the first is to migrate our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top. The second is to change the de-duplication logic applied to redshift/postgres to bring it in line with the other warehouses (keeping 1 of the duplicate records, instead of discarding them all). We also upgrade some macros and update some of our docs.

snowplow-web 0.14.0 (2023-03-28)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version contains two major changes, the first is to migrate our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top. The second is to change the de-duplication logic applied to redshift/postgres to bring it in line with the other warehouses (keeping 1 of the duplicate records, instead of discarding them all). We also upgrade some macros and update some of our docs.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
### Changes to materialization
To take advantage of the optimization we apply to the `incremental` materialization, users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` :
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models please refer to the [snowplow utils migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) and the latest docs on [creating custom incremental models](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models).

### Redshift/Postgres custom contexts
The change in de-duplication logic means that now the `events_this_run` and downstream tables will contain events that may have duplicates within your self-describing-events or context tables. Previously these events were discarded do there was no risk of duplication when joining a sde/context in a custom model, you must now make sure to de-dupe your sde/context before joining in any custom models. See the `models/optional_modules/consent/scratch/default/snowplow_web_consent_events_this_run.sql` file for an example, and the docs [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#guidelines--best-practice).

## Features
- Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
- Migrate all models to use new materialization
- Remove `snowplow__incremental_materialization` variable
- Change de-duplication logic on redshift/postgres

## Docs
- Typo fixes
- Update to readme

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file, and ensuring you have followed the above steps. You can read more in our [upgrade guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/web/#upgrading-to-0140)

snowplow-web 0.13.3 (2023-03-24)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This is a patch release which fixes an issue with enabling contexts on databricks.

## Features
- Fix databricks context macro (Close #181)

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.14.0-rc2 (2023-03-10)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This is a pre-release version of the package, we believe it to be in working condition but you may encounter bugs and some features may change before the final release.**

This version migrates the rest of our models (consent and custom examples) to the new materialization, and uses new macros in place of those we have deprecated.

As a reminder Users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` to benefit from the enhancements:
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models and more details, please refer to our temporary docs page: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-advanced-usage/dbt-incremental-logic-pre-release/

## Features
Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
Migrate consent and custom models to use new materialization
Remove `snowplow__incremental_materialization` variable
## Docs
Small typo fixes
Small update to readme

snowplow-web 0.14.0-rc1 (2023-03-06)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This is a pre-release version of the package, we believe it to be in working condition but you may encounter bugs and some features may change before the final release.**

This version of the package begins the migration away from our `snowplow_incremental` materialization and uses an overwrite to the standard `incremental` materialization to provide the same performance improvements but in a simpler way. We expect users should see little to no performance change from the previous version, please let us know if you see performance degradation for large volumes of data.

Users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` to benefit from the enhancements:
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models and more details, please see more details on our temporary docs page: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-advanced-usage/dbt-incremental-logic-pre-release/

## Features
Use new materialization

snowplow-web 0.13.2 (2023-02-27)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This is a patch release with the purpose to unblock those Redshift/Postgres users who are using enrichments. The macros we introduced were not correctly parsing the table aliases for the enrichments loaded in Redshift/Postgres. This has now been fixed.

## Features
- Fix whitespace issue on redshift sessions (Close #166)
- Fix context prefix argument usage (Close #167)

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.13.1 (2023-02-24)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This is a patch release with the purpose to unblock those Redshift/Postgres users whose loaders do not send `load_tstamp` field to their events table: they use `Postgres loader` or `RDB Loader` below v4.0.0. Please note that they will not be able to use the Consent models but the general web model will still be supported.

## Upgrading
Apart from bumping the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file, impacted users will need to set a newly introduced variable: `snowplow__enable_load_tstamp` to `false`.


snowplow-web 0.13.0 (2023-02-22)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds Databricks, Redshift and Postgres support for the optional Consent module. As a breaking change we are decoupling sessions from pageviews, please refer to the below breakdown on this. It also removes unnecessary `domain_userid` tests which would fail due to anonymous tracking. We also fix some integration tests.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- The way we generate the sessions table has changed, breaking the dependency on the page views table and instead building directly from page view and ping events. This means we now include sessions that contain only page-pings, and all stray page pings in sessions, see our [docs](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-web-data-model/#stray-page-pings) for more information about what this means. You do not need to make any changes to your tables or data, but **you will likely see an increase in the number of sessions overall**, and may see a small increase in absolute and engaged time on individual sessions (to account for those starting with a stray page ping). Any reporting off the sessions table should be interpreted accordingly, or the data re-processed (see [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models-2) for how to reprocess a single model).

## 🚨 Prerequisite Alert 🚨
Redshift/Postgres users would need to use `RDB Loader v4.0.0` and above as the web model for them relies on the `load_tstamp` field from now on. The same dependency applies for the Consent module users regardles of warehouse as that field is utilised for the incremental logic.

## Features
- Fixed sessions being dependant on snowplow_web_user_mapping even when session stitching was disabled (Close #155)
- Added alias argument to the `filter_bots` macro for more flexibility
- Migrated engaged time to use device timestamps instead of derived to provide more accurate calculation when there is a delay between events being sent and the collector receiving them
- Added `get_optional_fields` macro to reduce duplication of calls to contexts across models
- Added missing adapter support for Consent module (Close #148)

## Under the hood
- Tidied up some macro inheritance
- Improved macro documentation
- Improvements to integration test

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file, taking account of the breaking changes above.

snowplow-web 0.12.4 (2023-01-25)

snowplow-web 0.12.0 (2022-12-08)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This release drops support for dbt versions below 1.3.** In order to support the new dbt-utils major release, we need to drop support for dbt versions below 1.3. As a result, we've stopped using macros from dbt-utils which removes the deprecation warnings users were seeing.

## Features
Drop support for dbt versions below 1.3 (Close #123)

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file. **You will need dbt v1.3 at least to be able to use this version of the package.**

snowplow-web 0.11.0 (2022-12-07)

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file. If you are running the web package on **Databricks**, you will need to run the following SQL to take advantage of the performance optimizations in this release. Be sure to replace `{catalog_name}` with your catalog name if your environment is UC enabled, and remove it if not. Also be sure to replace `{manifest_schema}` with the name of the schema where your manifest is currently found.

```sql
CREATE TABLE {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest_tmp
    USING DELTA
    PARTITIONED BY (start_tstamp_date)
    tblproperties ('delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true' , 'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact' = 'true'
    ) AS

    SELECT *,
            DATE(start_tstamp) as start_tstamp_date
    FROM {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest;

ALTER TABLE {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest_tmp RENAME TO {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest;
